					I'm from Magnitogorsk, Russia. I used to go to Robotics club, 
					where I was working with the Lego Mindstorms platform. That was many years ago, in childhood.
					After a while, I started making my own games on Unity. I've made a lot of games,
					but then it got boring for me and I decited to learn python and JS. On python, I made several 
					VK and Telegram bots. Then I interested in the Front-End development and began to study the 
					tech that are included in it.
