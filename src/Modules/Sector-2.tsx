				<p className="main-article_paragraph">I was born in Magnitogorsk, Russia. I used to go to Robotics club, where I was working on the Lego Mindstorms platform. That was many years ago, in childhood, but I understood the basic programming algorithm there. After a while, I started making my own games on Unity. I've made about 10 games in a year, but then it got boring for me and I decited to learn python and JS. I took my first request and I've completed it. This was beginig of my programming career.</p>
